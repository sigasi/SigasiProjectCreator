SigasiProjectCreator
====================

This project offers two Python classes that make it easy to generate a Sigasi Project from your own project
 specifications. The @SigasiProjectCreator.py@ file has two classes that you can use to create the project file and
 the corresponding Library configuration files.

@convertToSigasiProject.py@ is an example scripts that creates a `.project` and a `.library_mapping.xml` file from a
 csv file that describes paths to VHDL files and their library mapping. See test-files for example input.

See http://www.sigasi.com/content/setting-project for multiple ways to setup a project.
